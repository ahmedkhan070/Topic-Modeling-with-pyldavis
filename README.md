# Topic Modeling and Visualization with PyLDAvis

This project demonstrates how to perform topic modeling using a corpus of text documents and visualizes the results with PyLDAvis. Topic modeling is a data analysis technique that discovers abstract topics within a collection of documents. PyLDAvis is a visualization tool that provides an interactive representation of the topic model.

## Introduction

Topic modeling is a technique used to discover hidden topics in a corpus of text documents. In this project, a topic model is created using a chosen method, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The results are visualized using PyLDAvis, an interactive tool that provides insights into the relationships between topics, terms, and documents.

## Features

- Uses a topic modeling algorithm to discover topics in a corpus of documents.
- Visualizes topic model results using PyLDAvis.
- Can handle various datasets with textual data.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
    - Run the script to perform topic modeling and visualize the results with PyLDAvis.
    ```bash
    python topic_modeling.py
    ```

2. **Provide Input Parameters**:
    - The script will prompt you to input parameters such as the number of topics and other options.

3. **View Visualization**:
    - The system will generate an interactive visualization of the topic model using PyLDAvis.

## Data

- The dataset used in this project consists of a corpus of text documents.
- The data can be preprocessed as needed before applying the topic modeling algorithm.

## Topic Modeling

- Topic modeling is performed using an algorithm such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or other similar methods.
- The algorithm discovers hidden topics in the corpus of documents and assigns topics to each document.

## Visualization with PyLDAvis

- PyLDAvis is a visualization tool that provides an interactive representation of the topic model results.
- The visualization includes information such as topic-term distributions, term relevance, and document-topic relationships.
- Users can interact with the visualization to explore the topics and terms in detail.

## Code Explanation

- **topic_modeling.py**:
    - The script for loading the corpus, applying the topic modeling algorithm, and generating visualizations with PyLDAvis.
    - Takes user input for parameters such as the number of topics.
    - Outputs the topic model results and visualizations using PyLDAvis.
